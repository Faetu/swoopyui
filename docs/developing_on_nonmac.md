# Developing on a non-mac device
First of all, you cannot start a `swoopyui` window on a non-mac device. But you can start a `swoopyui` host and preview its content with the `preview` feature if you are using a `swoopyui` previewing app for example on mobile.

Check this page for more information about the `preview` feature: [swoopyui preview](https://github.com/SKbarbon/swoopyui/blob/main/docs/swoopyui_preview.md)
